# Introduction

Claude Deck is a self-hosted web application for visualizing and managing [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) configuration. It provides a unified interface for managing MCP servers, plugins, slash commands, hooks, agents, permissions, usage tracking, and other Claude Code extensions.

## Why Claude Deck?

Claude Code stores configuration across multiple JSON files and directories (`~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.mcp.json`, and more). Managing these files manually is tedious and error-prone. Claude Deck gives you a visual dashboard to:

- **See everything at a glance** — dashboard with counts, session activity, and context window usage
- **Edit configuration visually** — no more hand-editing JSON files
- **Manage MCP servers** — add, test, and configure servers with OAuth support
- **Track usage** — monitor token costs, billing blocks, and daily/monthly trends
- **Browse sessions** — view conversation transcripts with tool use details
- **Monitor live sessions** — attach to running Claude Code terminals via CC Bridge
